     * substitutions) required to change one word into the other.
     *
     * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance
     *
     * It is always at least the difference of the sizes of the two strings.
     * It is at most the length of the longer string.
     * It is zero if and only if the strings are equal.
     * If the strings are the same size, the Hamming distance is an upper bound
     * on the Levenshtein distance.
     * The Levenshtein distance verifies the triangle inequality (the distance
     * between two strings is no greater than the sum Levenshtein distances from
     * a third string).
     *
     * Implementation uses dynamic programming (Wagner–Fischer algorithm), with
     * only 2 rows of data. The space requirement is thus O(m) and the algorithm
     * runs in O(mn).
